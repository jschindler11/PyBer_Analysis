# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the differences in rideshare usage between Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities. We created a summary dataframe that gave us, for each city type, the:
  1) Total Number of Rides
  2) Total Number of Drivers
  3) Total Fares Price
  4) Average Fare per Ride
  5) Average Fare per Driver
 
 We also determined the total fares per week for each city type.
