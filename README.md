# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the differences in rideshare usage between Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities. We created a summary dataframe that gave us, for each city type, the:
  1) Total Number of Rides
  2) Total Number of Drivers
  3) Total Fares Price
  4) Average Fare per Ride
  5) Average Fare per Driver
 
 We also determined the total fares per week for each city type.

## Results

There were 5 times as many rides in Suburban cities than there were in Rural cities, and there were 13 times as many rides in Urban cities than there were in Rural cities.

There were 16 times as many drivers in Suburban cities than there were in Rural cities, and there were 111 times as many drivers in Urban cities than there were in Rural cities.

The total fares were 4.5 times higher in Suburban cities than they were in Rural cities, and the total fares were 9.2 times higher in Urban cities than they were in Rural cities.

## Summary

Based on the results, my reccomendations are:
  1) Lower the average fare of a ride in Rural cities to incentivize more use and increase the number of total riders
  2) Provide incentives to drivers to select rides in Suburban and Rural cities to increase the number of total riders in these two city types
  3) Support a campaign for the use of public transportation in Urban cities so more drivers are available for rides in Suburban and Rural cities
